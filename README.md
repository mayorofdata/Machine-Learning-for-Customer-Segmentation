# Marketing Data for Customer Segmentation

This project aims to analyze marketing data for customer segmentation using various techniques including K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.

## Steps:

1. **Import Libraries and Datasets**: Begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the marketing data for analysis.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning **: Explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and prepare it for further analysis.

3. **K-means Clustering**: Implement K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their behavior and characteristics.

4. **Find the Optimal Number of Clusters Using Elbow Method**: Utilize the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm.

5. **Apply Principal Component Analysis and Visualize the Results**: Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the clusters in a lower-dimensional space.

6. **Understand the Theory and Intuition Behind Autoencoders**: Gain an understanding of autoencoders and their role in dimensionality reduction.

7. **Apply Autoencoders**: Implement autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction on the dataset, potentially improving clustering performance and interpretation.

By following these steps, this project aims to provide insights into customer segmentation using advanced analytical techniques, ultimately aiding in marketing strategy development and decision-making processes.
